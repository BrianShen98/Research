This is the formatted version of VEIL dataset. Things I did:

1. replace propositions that start with (state ...) with two-object proposition e.g. (state Cup1 water)  ->  (Cup1 HasWater)

2. format the verb clause to be a more formal structure:

  Obj1:
  Obj2:
  Obj3:
  ...
  Verb:
  Rel12:
  Rel13:
  Rel23:
  
3. modified some environment change to make them more accurate(a copy of original mapping is also posted in the repo)
